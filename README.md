# Encrypter

This is just a little encrypter & decrypter that I made for fun.
I feel as if I have created something else other than an encrypter because I have not created it how an actualy encrypter should actually be made.
There are active bugs which I am trying to deal with currently but if you don't write a long sentence then it will not struggle to encrypt & decrypt it.
It doesn't require a password and comes with a decrypting application which can be used to decrypt the encryption.
No source code because then you'll know how the encryption works and it won't be an encrypter anymore
