# Encrypter

This is just a little encrypter & decrypter that I have wrote.
There are active bugs which I am trying to deal with currently but if you don't write a long sentence then it will not struggle to encrypt it.
It doesn't require a password and comes with a decrypting application which can be used to decrypt the encryption.
No source code because then you'll know how the encryption works and it won't be an encrypter anymore
